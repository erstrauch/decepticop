    <h3><u>Study background</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We suspect that heavy gamers have cardiovascular heart problems at higher rates than the general population.</li>
            <li>Studies show that intense gameplay can be a stressor for those with heart conditions.</li>
            <li>Heartbeat often manifests irregularly in those with heart conditions during intense gameplay.</li>
            <li>Undiagnosed heart conditions may cause some at-risk players to experience adverse health effects.</li>
            <li>To address this, we are developing a lightweight system which performs Eularian Video Magnification, a video processing method, and can remotely infer heart rate using a webcam.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3><u>Partipation role</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In this experiment, you are in the <u>control group</u> (non-heavy gamer).</li>
            <li>We will record your face while you play the card game, "BS" against a computer.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3><u>Instructions</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Please try to keep your face clearly in the frame at all times.</li>
            <li>If you wear glasses, or have other facial occlusions, please remove them during this study.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        Do you accept the above terms and conditions?
