# Caught Ya Cheatin'

## Background


Deception has changed in the age of technology. Lying and cheating to computers is fundamentally different from lying face-to-face. Can software be used to determine what deception of computers looks like?
* Eye-tracking
* Micro expressions
* Heart rate

## Goals


* Design a game that tricks users into deceiving the computer
* Record users responses and analyze video on different autonomic responses
* Create software that can be used by deception researchers for experiment related to deception of computers.


## Limitations


Individual differences in deception cues are always a possibility. While a large aggregation of data could reveal the general clues of deception, individual responses might be highly varied.
    In addition, basing deception cues off of autonomic responses that are also related to stress mean that  high-stress situations or subjects with high anxiety may produce false positives.
Ethical Questions
    Needfinding revealed that potential consumers of this technology have some reservations about the ethical implications of deception detection. These concerns manifested in two main areasâ€”accuracy and privacy.
    Some survey respondents expressed concerns that being able to easily  detect deception would mean that their right to privacy would be infringed upon. Certainly one could imagine that good deception detection could lead to the end of the right to withhold information. Whether or not this is a good thing, or if these concerns outweigh the benefits, is still in question.


## Technology


deckofcardsapi.com gave all of the card resources and allowed easy randomization and keeping track of which player had which card. 

Most of the front end was done in vanilla js, though some jquery was used. 

Face tracking is done through Gaze Tracking.
